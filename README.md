HnS Netai website projects code
-------------------------------

Includes small projects I've worked on such as a text alert system that texts me when my website goes down, hns netai api which allows people to easily integrate user accounts with their website, hns contacts which allows people to store the name, number, and email for multiple people, a craigslist script I wrote to help my brother search for a certain type of motorcycle in multiple cities along with different appliances in 3 cities closest to where he lived. When new items were posted that matched his search criteria he would be texted with the new items so he didn't have to browse though hundreds of pages saving him hours of time. This also includes the project I created while competing in PassportParking's programming competition. Parking is a calculator that allows multiple users to enter calculations for everyone to work with. HnS Quotes is a website that people can use to store inspirational quotes they've found over the years in an online portfolio or even browse through quotes that other users have found valuable enough to record. I also created a tool called Text that allows people to text my cell phone from a website. Web Surprise is an anonymous website submitter that loads submitted websites for all other connected users.
